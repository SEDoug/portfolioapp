# Portfolioapp - a simple web application used for showcasing my applied full stack development knowledge "in progress"

Created by @DougMacGregor || http://doug-macgregor.webflow.io/

This is a simple web application written in python, flask-microframework, and bootstrap. I have used code from other programmers to learn how all the pieces work.  I will be tweaking the application to fit my needs and explain what I have learned along the way.

I have also mixed in a personal book inventory application that is also written in python with the help of php and mysql.  More about this project can be found here:  https://github.com/SEDoug/bookapp
