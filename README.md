# A simple web application to showcase skills while seeking full stack development knowledge.

Seeking a broader field and desire to do work in full stack development.

This is a simple web application written in python, flask-microframework, and bootstrap. I will be tweaking the application to fit my needs and explain what I have learned along the way.

I have also mixed in a personal book inventory application that is also written in python with the help of php and mysql.  More about this project can be found here:  https://github.com/SEDoug/bookapp
